=============        PyWeb README File   ===================

* About PyWeb

PyWeb is a library developped
 in the Python programming language (python.org)
that aims to give the web developper a powerful library to
 develop his site
using Python.

* Wait...Django! can do this, no ?

Django! is a very good library, its only problem 
is that it MUST run on a
Web server with Python installed, which is not the case of common (free)
webhosting services.

* And so, 
what is the difference with PyWeb ?

PyWeb is different: you type Python code and it generates a complete
xHTML/CSS webpage. You
 can even use PHP and access a SQLite database !

* Okay, but I found a bug with this library, what to do ?

First of all, think about 
the priority of the founded bug. If it is just
a W3C error, it's not really important, you can send me a mail and I will correct
it for
 future versions.
If it is a generating error or a misdocumented function, correct the bug, do
a patch and send it to me via email with the title: "IMPORTANT PYWEB: <your_bug>".
